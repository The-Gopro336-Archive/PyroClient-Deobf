# PyroClient-Deobf
 Pyro client v1.4.1 deobfuscated
 
 Previously binsecured
  
 variable and method names as well as some class file names have beed renamed to valid, generic names (The real, pre-obfuscation names are long gone)
 
 used fernflower instead of cfr, becuase it better handles the deobfuscated code
 
 Credit to Crystallinqq for the cracked jar, which was used for this.
 
 dmca if ur a pedophile, a registered sex offender, british and if you groom children :^)
